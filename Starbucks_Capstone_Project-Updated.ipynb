    "# Starbucks Capstone Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This data set contains simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Not all users receive the same offer, and that is the challenge to solve with this data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to combine transaction, demographic and offer data to determine which demographic groups respond best to which offer type. This data set is a simplified version of the real Starbucks app because the underlying simulator only has one product whereas Starbucks actually sells dozens of products.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every offer has a validity period before the offer expires. As an example, a BOGO offer might be valid for only 5 days. You'll see in the data set that informational offers have a validity period even though these ads are merely providing information about a product; for example, if an informational offer has 7 days of validity, you can assume the customer is feeling the influence of the offer for 7 days after receiving the advertisement.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll be given transactional data showing user purchases made on the app including the timestamp of purchase and the amount of money spent on a purchase. This transactional data also has a record for each offer that a user receives as well as a record for when a user actually views the offer. There are also records for when a user completes an offer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind as well that someone using the app might make a purchase through the app without having received an offer or seen an offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "To give an example, a user could receive a discount offer buy 10 dollars get 2 off on Monday. The offer is valid for 10 days from receipt. If the customer accumulates at least 10 dollars in purchases during the validity period, the customer completes the offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are a few things to watch out for in this data set. Customers do not opt into the offers that they receive; in other words, a user can receive an offer, never actually view the offer, and still complete the offer. For example, a user might receive the \"buy 10 dollars get 2 dollars off offer\", but the user never opens the offer during the 10 day validity period. The customer spends 15 dollars during those ten days. There will be an offer completion record in the data set; however, the customer was not influenced by the offer because the customer never viewed the offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes data cleaning especially important and tricky.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll also want to take into account that some demographic groups will make purchases even if they don't receive an offer. From a business perspective, if a customer is going to make a 10 dollar purchase without an offer anyway, you wouldn't want to send a buy 10 dollars get 2 dollars off offer. You'll want to try to assess what a certain demographic group will buy when not receiving any offers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Advice\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this is a capstone project, you are free to analyze the data any way you see fit. For example, you could build a machine learning model that predicts how much someone will spend based on demographics and offer type. Or you could build a model that predicts whether or not someone will respond to an offer. Or, you don't need to build a machine learning model at all. You could develop a set of heuristics that determine what offer you should send to each customer (i.e., 75 percent of women customers who were 35 years old responded to offer A vs 40 percent from the same demographic to offer B, so send offer A)."

The DecisionTreeClassifier model stands out with a superior performance, achieving a test F1 score of 91.02%, significantly surpassing the benchmark. Meanwhile, the RandomForestClassifier model also performs well relative to the benchmark, attaining a test F1 score of 80.57%. Given that our problem does not demand extremely high F1 scores, these results are deemed satisfactory and adequate for classification tasks aimed at predicting customer response to offers."

      "n_estimators: The number of trees in the forest. Higher values can improve performance but also increase computation time.\n",
      "max_depth: The maximum depth of the trees. Deeper trees can capture more complex patterns but may lead to overfitting.\n",
      "min_samples_split: The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node. Higher values can prevent overfitting.\n",

      "\n",
      "Parameter Selection and Impact on Performance:\n",
      "For n_estimators, a value of 100 was selected to balance performance and computation time.\n",
      "max_depth was set to None to allow the trees to grow until all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than min_samples_split samples.\n",
      "min_samples_split and min_samples_leaf were set to default values to start with, but they were fine-tuned through grid search to optimize performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trade-offs and Limitations:\n",
      "Increasing n_estimators can improve performance but also increases computation time.\n",
      "Deeper trees (higher max_depth) can capture more complex patterns but may lead to overfitting.\n",
      "Higher values of min_samples_split and min_samples_leaf can prevent overfitting but may lead to underfitting if set too high.\n"

    "\"After evaluating different machine learning models, the RandomForestClassifier outperformed the DecisionTreeClassifier and KNeighborsClassifier on both the training and test datasets in terms of F1 score. The RandomForestClassifier achieved a train F1 score of 87.93% and a test F1 score of 80.57%. The DecisionTreeClassifier also performed well with a train F1 score of 92.67% and a test F1 score of 91.02%. However, the KNeighborsClassifier showed lower performance with a train F1 score of 54.86% and a test F1 score of 34.86%. Therefore, we select the RandomForestClassifier as the best model for predicting customer response to offers. This model's performance is satisfactory for our classification task and can be deployed for practical use.\""
